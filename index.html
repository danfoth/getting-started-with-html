  <h1>Basics of the Web</h1>
<p>The web is a collection of HTML (<em>HyperText Markup Language</em>) documents. <br>These pages are stored on servers and accessed through your browser sending an HTTP request <br>to the server.</p>
<b>Browser</b>
<p>The browser is a program that enables the user to view web pages. Internet Explorer, <br>Google Chrome, and Firefox are all examples of browsers.</p> 
<b>Servers</b>
<p>Servers are computers with no real frontend. Their purpose is merely to host the HTML <br>web document.</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<p>HTML mainly contains two elements; text and markup. Text is the general text content <br>and markup is the <em>style</em> of the text.</p>
<b>Tags</b>
<p>Tags provide the ability to add different styles to the text. A good list of these tags can be <br>found <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/>here.</a> The combination of the opening and closing tags, along with the content is <br>known as an element.</p>
